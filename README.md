## Key Features

- **Secure Web3 Integration**: Connects directly to your browser-based Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Your private keys are never exposed.
- **Instant Transactions**: Optimized to send USD₮ transactions to the blockchain quickly and efficiently.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Check your USD₮ balance and get immediate status updates on your transactions.
- **Access Control System**: A simulated payment gateway demonstrates how users would purchase a license to access the application's core functionality.
- **Professional UI/UX**: A clean, responsive, and branded interface for a trustworthy user experience.
- **Advanced SEO**: Fully optimized for search engines with comprehensive meta tags and JSON-LD structured data for rich search results.

## How It Works

The application is designed to be straightforward. Here’s the user flow:

1.  **Purchase a License**: To access the sender functionality, users must first acquire a license via the "Get Access Now!" buttons. The application features a simulated payment modal to demonstrate this process.
2.  **Unlock the Tool**: Upon "payment," a 90-day license is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, and the sender tool is unlocked.
3.  **Connect Your Wallet**: Users click the "Connect Wallet" button to securely link their MetaMask or other Web3 wallet.
4.  **Enter Details & Send**: Once connected, the user's address and USD₮ balance are displayed. They can then enter the recipient's address and the amount of USD₮ to send.
5.  **Confirm Transaction**: Clicking "Send USD₮" prompts the user to confirm the transaction in their wallet, including gas fees.
6.  **Receive Confirmation**: The application provides a status update once the transaction is successfully processed and confirmed on the blockchain.

## Technical Stack

-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **Blockchain Integration**: `ethers.js` for interacting with the Ethereum network and the USD₮ smart contract.
-   **SEO**: Comprehensive meta tags and `application/ld+json` structured data.
-   **Design**: Responsive design with Font Awesome for icons.
